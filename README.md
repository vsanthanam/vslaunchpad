# find me on the internet

Like many of us on GitHub, I've got a [personal webslte](https://www.vsanthanam.com) that contains some general informatinon about me and my profile as an engineer.

But, as time as gone on, I've found my portifolio & methods of contact splintering into donzens of accounts, urls, and repositories.

Then, it occured to me that I have a domain, `vsanthanam.com`. I was able to set up subdomains to forward to my profile or project of choice using `{identity} [dot] vsanthanam [dot] com`

This way, I could easily send someone to, say, my LinkedIn profile with the following easy to remember url: `https://linkedin.vsanthanam.com`

 I wanted to make a visual prepresentation of my online identies and projects, so I built this this simple React.js app that allows a user to easily find exactly what they're looking for.

 * this project was bootstrapped with [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), and is hosted on [surge.sh](https://surge.sh).
 * additional cra scripts from [custom-react-scripts](https://www.npmjs.com/package/custom-react-scripts)
 * CSS preprocessing with [LESS](https://lesscss.org)
